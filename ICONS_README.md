# PWA Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files:

## Required Icons

1. **icon-192.png** - 192×192px PNG icon
2. **icon-512.png** - 512×512px PNG icon

## Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable icon related to music or ear training
- Suggestions: musical note, ear symbol, treble clef, or abstract sound waves
- Use the app's color scheme:
  - Background: `#FAF7F2` (Soft Oatmeal)
  - Accent: `#E6D9F6` (Gentle Lavender)
  - Text: `#5A5651` (Soft Charcoal)
- Make sure the icon works well on both light and dark backgrounds
- Keep it simple - it needs to be recognizable at small sizes
